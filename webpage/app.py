                # Introduction 
                
                Hi, and welcome to our website made for our final project in the course [02806](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02806) Social Data Science and Visualization! 
                
                Our project explores vehicle collisions in New York City using a [data set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD). In particular, we would like to focus on and analyze the collisions that resulted in a serious outcome. We define a serious outcome as a collision where at least one person was either injured or killed. Of the 1,450,554 records of collisions in the data set 292,951 are serious as per our definition which is about 20%.

                
                The website is thus aimed at providing insight as to where and when it is most likely for a collision to be serious as well as look at what is most likely to contribute to a collision being serious.
                
                #Defining Serious Collisions

                For this project, we defined serious collisions as collisions where people are either injured or killed. By using this definition, the goal of Vision Zero is to eliminate all serious traffic collisions in New York City by 2024, and the analysis presented here could therefore help achieve this goal. For a future project, it would be interesting to look more into lethal car collisions, but there is *luckily* not a lot of data on that.  
                
                
                **Percentages:**
                
                | Number of persons injured <br> Number of persons killed | False  | True   |
                |---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
                | False                                                   | 79.824 | 20.058 |
                | True                                                    | 0.087  | 0.028  |
                
                **Numbers**
                
                | Number of persons injured <br> Number of persons killed | False   | True   |
                |---------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|
                | False                                                   | 1157463 | 290857 |
                | True                                                    | 1276    | 417    |

                As we can see from the tables above, very few collisions are deadly and therefore we defined *serious* as either injuring or deadly.
