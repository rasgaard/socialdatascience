                Hi, and welcome to our website made for our final project in the course [02806 Social Data Science and Visualization!](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02806) (To open links, you may need to right click->Open in new tab because of Dash weirdness.)
                
                Our project explores vehicle collisions in New York City using a [data set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD).
                
                The problem of car collisions in New York city is estimated to cost the city's economy $4 billion yearly when taking everything from medical expenses to property damage into account. We would like to help with understanding *when* and *where* this problem occurs as that is often the first step to prevention. We will also look at a few selected topics of interest to analyse further. 

                We encourage you, the reader, to interact with our visualizations to hopefully get the full experience and learn something new and exciting.
                ## Defining Serious Collisions

                For this project, we defined serious collisions as collisions where people are either injured or killed. By using this definition, the goal of [Vision Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero_(New_York_City)) is to eliminate all serious traffic collisions in New York City by 2024, and the analysis presented here could therefore help achieve this goal. For a future project, it would be interesting to look more into lethal car collisions, but there is *luckily* not a lot of data on that, with only 0.115% of collisions resulting in someone being killed.

                From the two plots above, we can see that Brooklyn has the highest number of collisions as well as the highest risk of a collision being serious. Most of inner Brooklyn has speed limits of 25 mph, while Belt Pwky that runs along the outskirts of Brooklyn has 50 mph. All in all, Brooklyn has a lot of roads with Belt Pkwy being a very has a lot of traffic to and from JFK airport. 
                
                On the other end, we can see that while Manhattan has the lowest risk of a collision being serious, which matches well with Manhattan having very low speed limits. Now, instead of grouping by borough, let's see if any new patterns arise if we group on ZIP code instead!

                Also, some ZIP codes had very few observations for specific hours, so if you notice that some ZIP codes are disappearing and appearing, it is because ZIP codes with less than 10 total collisions for a given hour is removed. Check e.g ZIP 11697 at hours **09:00** versus **10:00**, it's right there at the bottom!

        In the bottom plot we see that the amount of collisions with Alcohol Involvement as a contributing factor peaks in 2017. From this, we suspected that we could not see any effect over the years of Vision Zero's campaign 'Choices', which targets the problem of driving under the influence of alcohol by informing the public about the safety risks. 
        
        The plot above shows on the other hand the seriousness of Alcohol Involment, i.e. given you are in a collision, what is the probability of that collision being serious? By looking at this metric instead of just counting occurences we see a clear effect that might be caused by the campaign. The campaign was launched in March 2016 and already in 2017 the change from the previous year was decreased with 2.23 %. The apparent success of the campaign was on the other hand short, and already in 2018 the probability increased with 1.24 %.

It can be difficult to say why exactly that is, but it is most likely some sort of change in the way the data is reported. With that aside, we can see that the number of daily collisions with Driver Inattention/Distraction was rather steady from mid-2016 and until COVID-19 hit New York City in March 2020. As we saw earlier with the contributing factors, Driver Inattention/Distraction is a very large contributing factor and also very broad - it could definitely be split into more specific categories such as cell-phone usage or alike.

            # Summary 
            
            To conclude we have analyzed the data as to where and when serious collisions happen and brought it to life using interactive visualizations. 

            In addition, we have also looked at a few specific cases of contributing factors or times of interest (Alcohol Involvement, Driver Inattention/Distraction and COVID-19) to confirm or deny hypotheses we had about the data.

            We will now highlight a few key points: 
            * Luckily, very few collisions are deadly, which is why it makes sense to define â€˜Seriousâ€™ as a collision being either injuring or deadly.

            * The highest risk of a collision being serious is found in Brooklyn, and the lowest was found to be in Staten Island.

            * Within the different boroughs, we found local patterns in the different zip codes. 

            * We found that the probability of serious crashes is very time dependent, where collisions happening late at night are generally more at risk of being serious than crashes around noon. 

            * We saw the contributing factors each had a different effect on the risk of a collision being lethal or serious. Factors that involve pedestrians/cyclists had a high risk of being serious, whereas factor such like â€˜Unsafe Lane Changingâ€™ were generally low risk of being serious.
            
            * During the first lockdown in 2020, the number of non-serious collisions fell drastically, but the number of serious collisions did not. This could indicate that staying at home reduced the number of non-serious collisions e.g. rush hour collisions.
        
            * The effect of Vision Zero campaign â€˜Choicesâ€™ targeting driving while influenced by alcohol only seemed to have a short term fix in the probability of a collision being serious. 
            
            * For the contributing factor â€˜Driver Inattention/Distractionâ€™, we saw an increase in 2016. One explanation could be that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ended after a year long campaign. It could also be seen that apart from COVID-19 in 2020, there was not a clear upwards trend.
